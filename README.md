resurrect-deleted-wordpress-users
=================================

Given a working WordPress installation, certain conditions (as described in comments) and a csv with a bunch of old post information in it, this script tries to "resurrect" the posts of old users that were accidentally deleted. 

It worked well for me, but YMMV -- I haven't tested it with the vast majority of WordPress core versions, and I do not remember which version we were using at the time I wrote/ran this.
